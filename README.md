### How Deploy to Cloudflare Works

Here's what happens when you click the button:

1. Cloudflare creates a copy of this repository in your GitHub or GitLab account
2. You provide configuration options:
   - **Project name** (e.g. "formzero")
   - **Database name** (e.g. "formzero")
   - **Auth secret** (use [jwtsecrets.com](https://jwtsecrets.com) or `openssl rand -hex 16` to generate one)
3. Cloudflare builds and deploys FormZero to your account
4. You get a unique URL (e.g. `https://formzero.your-domain.workers.dev`) to access your dashboard

Read the [Cloudflare documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/deploy-buttons/) for more details.
